# double-encryption
## PROJECT TITLE <<Double file encryption system
# declaration
//The research and design of this system is the original work of:
<<CHRIS<<MURIUKI //muriukichriskithinji@gmail.com

## introduction
// Due to lack of security of stored files in computers,  i was provoked by the urge to develop an application that can be used to Encrypt and Decrypt data files as they are stored in the Computers. In my apploach,  i used two of the strongest Cryptographic Algorithms,  AES and RC2

## The objective of the file encryption system 
 // To attaining high level data sharing  integrity through double encryption and decryption of the test file and the resulting file.
## Problem statement.
// Caused by raising numbers of cyber crimes where most of them can be stopped by use of this file encryption web application at commercial and economical environment on essential data to enhance on data integrity.
## Technologies used.
 # For development the following languages were used.
 *HTML
 *CSS
 *JAVASCRIPT
# frameworks
  >node.js
  >crypto.js
# Cryptography and Data Security
# Data Encryption
# Data Transformation
# Web and Internet Technologies

## illustrations
 <<step1 choose what you what you want to do   (encrypt or decrypt )
 <<step2 choose a file from the file system(browse) 
 <<step3 upload a file
 <<step4 enter the passcode(remember the encryption pass should be used in decryption) 
 <<step5 file downloading(note no files are left in the server)
 <<step6 repeat step one for decryption
 <<step7 enter decrypting passcode should be encyption file encyption password)
 <<step8 downloading file
//NOTE; no files are left in the server.
 # scope of functionalities
//The Application covers Cryptography section Of Information Technology(Not limited to). and Employs HTML5 file picker technology that allows a file to be processed as it is Temporarily held by the web application.
